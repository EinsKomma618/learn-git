# People are bad at coding

Note: If you think about it, we do stupid things all the time

----

- "Fixed" some code, messed it up, and need to undo everything
- Deleted an important file and can't recover it
- Moved some code while refactoring and can't remember what it was
- Commented out code to remember it because you'll need it eventually
- Wrote something a long time ago and forgot why

Note: All of these thing suck, or make our code messy

----

# You Need Version Control

----

## Two Simple Actions

- Save snapshots of your project
- Restore to any given snapshot

Note: These two simple actions enable us to avoid all of the problems that we just looked at

----

- Easy rewind to the last working version
- Recover a file from a previous snapshot
- View previous snapshots to reference old versions
- Leave yourself notes and details outside of the code itself

----

## So many flavors!

- Wikipedia lists over 40 types of VCSs, Git is just one
- Git has been made popular in part thanks to Github and open-source code
- You don't have to use Git, but please use something!

# Collaboration

Note: Many version control system have well-defined ways for sharing code between multiple developers.  Basically, this allows you to sync the snapshots that you have on your computer with those that other people have to make sure that everyone has the same code

- Store code online
- Enables easy collaboration
- Find open source projects

----

# Open Source

- Tons of code available for use and learning, for free
- Big companies publish their code for other people to benefit from
- Anyone can contribute to any open source code

# How do I do it?
