## Enter Version Control

- Save snapshots of your project
- Restore to any given snapshot

Note: These versions are easy to browse through, so you can check out old versions of the project without needing to change a thing. This is great for keeping track of how something was done without needing to keep the code alive.

- Store code online
- Enables easy collaboration
- Find open source projects

----

# Open Source

- Tons of code available for use and learning, for free
- Big companies publish their code for other people to benefit from
- Anyone can contribute to any open source code

# How do I use it?
