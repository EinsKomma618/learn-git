# Introduction to Git

By Alex LaFroscia

---

# What is Git?

----

## Version Control!

- Save snapshots of your project
- Rewind to any given snapshot
- Easily work together on projects

----

## Why do I want this?

- Try out some code without wrecking your project
- Revert to a version where you know some feature worked
- Back up your code to the cloud

---

# How do I use it?

----

# Step 1: Writing

Write some code

----

# Step 2: Staging

Pick which changes you want to bundle together

```bash
$ git add index.html // Add changes from one file...
$ git add -A         // ... or all your current changes
```

----

# Step 3: Committing

Wrap the changes up in a _commit_ and give it a name

```bash
$ git commit -m 'Started index page'
$ git commit -m 'Fixed a major bug'
```

---

# Now what?

----

- View a list of all your changes
- Rewind the project to a specific _commit_
- Revert to the last _committed_ state
- Recover deleted files

----

# What about collaboration?

----
